# Train models

## Overview

`training_model_overview` - example of ttH vs ttW discriminator usaging of different tools, such as Scikitlearn, XGboost, Catboost - BDTs, and first trial of Keras and sequential NN.

`train_nn.ipynb` - closer look at NN with keras. More attention to input variables and their correlatrions

`training_inputs_importance` - [tbd] ways to improve the model by accounting correlations between input variables (features)

`training_multiclas` - project on simultaneous discrimination ttH vs ttW and ttbar
