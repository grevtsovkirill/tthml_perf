# Train models

## Overview

`training_model_overview` - example of ttH vs ttW discriminator usaging of different tools, such as Scikitlearn, XGboost, Catboost - BDTs, and first trial of Keras and sequential NN.

`training_multiclas` - project on simultaneous discrimination ttH vs ttW and ttbar

`training_inputs_importance` - ways to improve the model by accounting correlations between input variables (features)
